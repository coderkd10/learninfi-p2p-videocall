# Video Calling App

## Technical details

This is a react project which uses mobx and css-modules.  
It was bootstraped using create-react-app and since cra does not support
mobx and css-modules out of the box we used [`react-app-rewired`](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) (which is super ðŸ˜Ž).


## TODOs:

1. Disable volume unmute option for self video.
2. Flip icons
3. Add a divider between 1st two and last two icons.
